"""Coupled three-arm IK for data collection — the ik_study winner, adapted.

Wraps the study's validated deployment configuration
(`ik_study/RESULTS_FINAL.md`, `ik_study/COLLISION_STUDY.md`):

    pose_cost_analytic_jac ×3      pos 50 / ori 10
    limit_constraint               (pyroki augmented Lagrangian)
    smoothing                      w = 0.05 (velocity-scaled prev-config)
    centering                      w = 0.5  (range-normalized, arm joints)
    sphere self-collision          180 spheres · corpus-pruned pairs ·
                                   soft margin hinge · margin 20 mm · w = 100

One coupled solve per control tick replaces the previous per-arm
`solve_single_arm_ik` calls: all three arms share one least-squares problem,
which is what makes inter-arm collision terms meaningful.

Notes for this integration:
- End-effector links come from the CALLER (arm_config.ARM_CONFIG); the
  middle arm tracks `middle_camera_cover` (same as the study benchmarks).
  It must be downstream of the `middle_pan` joint or IK cannot control the
  camera-yaw motor (the collision model is link-based and unaffected by
  the IK target choice).
- Arms without a target this tick hold their current commanded pose (FK of
  prev_q) as an active target, so the coupled solve keeps them still.
- The study's weights are used verbatim and are deliberately NOT read from
  TeleopConfig (whose pos 40 / ori 0.25 / dq 0.18 belong to the old per-arm
  solver).  Expect much stiffer orientation tracking than before — that is
  the study's central correction, not a bug.  Tune here if the feel is off.
- Runs on CPU by design (study: ~5 ms/solve; GPU is slower at this problem
  size).  The env pin must happen before jax is imported anywhere.
