"""One switch for the three collision models, for A/B teleoperation.

    python data_collection.py --collision gjk

THE THREE MODELS DO NOT LIVE AT THE SAME LAYER
==============================================
This is the fact that makes a naive "swap the collision model" flag
misleading, so it is stated up front rather than hidden behind a preset.

There are two places collision geometry acts, and they are different in
kind:

  1. THE IK SOLVER'S SOFT COST.  A weighted residual the optimiser trades
     against pose tracking.  It shapes how the motion FEELS -- smooth,
     jerky, sluggish near obstacles -- and it must be DIFFERENTIABLE,
     because pyroki takes gradients through it.

  2. THE GATE.  A hard yes/no on the final clamped command, after the
     solver and after every clamp.  It decides WHERE YOU GET STOPPED and
     nothing else. It needs no gradients, only a conservative distance.

And so:

    sphere    solver only.  The 180-sphere model is INSCRIBED (optimistic
              by up to ~18 mm on true contact), which is fine for a soft
              cost and disqualifying for a gate: it cannot prove
              separation, so it can never be the last line of defence.

    capsule   both.  Circumscribed, differentiable, cheap -- but fat,
              padding the true surface by 28 mm on average and 61 mm on
              the gripper bases.

    GJK       gate only.  Exact, but it is an ITERATIVE algorithm with
              data-dependent branching and no useful gradient, so it
              cannot be an IK residual at all.  It answers "are these
              apart by at least X" and nothing more.

So the three presets below are not three settings of one knob.  Each is a
coherent configuration of both layers, and the banner prints exactly what
each one changed so a session's feel can be attributed correctly.


WHAT TO EXPECT, AND WHAT TO COMPARE
===================================
    sphere    the deployed baseline. The collision study's winner:
              0.60 mm / 0.24 deg clean p95, 5.2 ms mean solve.
    capsule   the study REJECTED this as a solver residual on simulation
              evidence -- 59-76 mm hand jerk, 33 % non-convergence, 43 ms
              solves. Measured 130 ms/solve on this machine's CPU jax.
              Feel it yourself; that is the point of the flag. Expect to
              need a lower control rate, and watch ik_overruns.
    gjk       same solver as `sphere`, but the gate is exact instead of
              fat: measured to stop the arms 27 mm closer to each other
              in real geometry while never touching.

The mode is recorded in the episode log, so which configuration produced
which recording is a fact about the data rather than something to
remember.
