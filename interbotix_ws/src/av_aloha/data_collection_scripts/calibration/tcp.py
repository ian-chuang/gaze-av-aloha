"""Tool centre point: commanding the grasp point instead of the flange.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
=======================
`arm_config.ARM_CONFIG[arm]["ee_link"]` is `*_gripper_base` -- the gripper
MOUNTING PLATE.  Every pose the IK tracks, every pose FK reports, and every
pose written into a dataset is that plate, not the point between the
fingers.

Two consequences, both of which show up the moment you put a ruler on the
robot:

1.  The grasp point sits about 72 mm further out along the plate's LOCAL
    +z (the approach axis).  So the world-frame z of the fingertips is not
    the world-frame z of `gripper_base`, and the gap between them depends
    on the wrist orientation -- it is the full 72 mm when the gripper
    points straight down, and zero when it points horizontally.

2.  Commanding a pure translation of the PLATE does not translate the
    FINGERS by the same amount unless the orientation holds exactly.  A
    lever arm turns orientation error into position error: at 72 mm, a
    10 deg tilt moves the fingertips 12.5 mm.  That is why "go up 5 cm"
    can undershoot at the fingertips while the plate itself tracked well.

Commanding in TCP space fixes both.  The target becomes the grasp point:

    T_world_flange = T_world_tcp @ inv(T_flange_tcp)

so the solver has to put the flange wherever it must to place the FINGERS
where you asked, and orientation drift is compensated automatically
instead of leaking into fingertip position.

WHAT THE DEFAULT OFFSET IS, AND ISN'T
=====================================
The default is DERIVED, not measured.  `giava.urdf` was flattened from the
upstream interbotix vx300s description and lost the gripper tail, including
its canonical grasp frame `ee_gripper_link`.  That frame sat at

    0.042825 + 0.025875 + 0.0385 = 0.1072 m  along gripper_link's +x

which, re-expressed in `gripper_base` coordinates, is (0, 0.00006, 0.0722).
It assumes GIAVA's custom fingers grasp where the stock ones did.

MEASURE IT.  Put the gripper somewhere you can reach, note where the
fingers actually close, and record the offset in tcp_offsets.json.  Until
then everything here is labelled `derived` rather than `measured`.

CONVENTION
    T_flange_tcp maps points from the TCP frame into the flange
    (`*_gripper_base`) frame, and is the pose of the TCP expressed in the
    flange.  Metres.  The TCP keeps the flange's ORIENTATION by default --
    only the origin moves -- so "TCP rpy" and "flange rpy" are the same
    unless you give a rotation too.
