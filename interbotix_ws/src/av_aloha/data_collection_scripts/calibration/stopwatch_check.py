"""End-to-end synchronisation check against a physical stopwatch.

Every other timing figure in this package is a claim the software makes
about itself.  This is the one test where the answer is written in the
scene: point all the cameras at a running stopwatch (a phone works), grab
one aligned set of frames, and tile them into a single image.  Read the
digits.  If the frames were captured at the same instant, they show the
same time.

That closes the loop the software cannot close on its own -- it validates
the clocks, the alignment, AND the assumption that a timestamp has anything
to do with when the photons landed.

WHAT TO EXPECT
    These cameras free-run; the D405 has no inter_cam_sync_mode, so there
    is no genlock.  With nearest-timestamp alignment the residual spread
    measured on this rig is ~1.7 ms.  A stopwatch showing hundredths (10 ms
    per digit step) therefore should USUALLY read the same on every camera,
    and occasionally differ by one step when a tick lands mid-exposure.
    Reading two or more steps apart, repeatably, means something is wrong.

    Use a stopwatch with MILLISECOND digits if you can. Hundredths can only
    prove you are within ~10 ms; milliseconds actually resolve the ~2 ms
    you are trying to see.

    Exposure time matters too: at 1/60 s the digits blur across ~16 ms of
    change regardless of how well aligned the cameras are. Bright light
    (short exposure) makes the digits crisp and the test meaningful.

  SET UP:
    1. Start a stopwatch showing at least hundredths -- milliseconds if you
       can get them. A phone works.
    2. Aim every camera at it. It must be readable in all of them at once,
       so a big display and a bright room help (bright light also shortens
       the exposure, which stops the digits blurring).
    3. Let it run and press ENTER.

  Then open the montage images and compare the digits panel to panel.
