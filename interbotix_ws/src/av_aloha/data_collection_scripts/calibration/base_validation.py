"""Physically measure the arm base placement in giava.urdf.

The base poses in the URDF are ASSERTIONS about how the rig is bolted
together.  Nothing in the software checks them, and every world-frame
quantity inherits their error: IK targets, inter-arm clearance, and any
camera extrinsic composed through T_world_ee.

The difficulty is that a base frame origin is a virtual point inside the
base plate and a base yaw is a direction, so neither can be measured with a
ruler directly.  Each protocol below turns one of them into a distance you
CAN measure, by using the robot itself as the instrument.

    waist-circle   base (x, y)      -- no IK, no FK, no camera
    straight       base yaw         -- one arm, one straightedge
    converge       relative pose    -- both arms, and yaw from two points

Run --list for the procedures, then e.g.

    python calibration/base_validation.py --protocol waist-circle --arm right
    python calibration/base_validation.py --protocol converge --dry-run

SAFETY: these move the arms through large sweeps.  Every waypoint is
checked against the deployed sphere self-collision model before anything
moves, and --dry-run does the whole thing with no hardware.

WAIST-CIRCLE  --  measures a base's (x, y) in the world frame
=============================================================
Why it works
    base_link -> shoulder_link is a pure +z translation, and the waist
    rotates about that same z.  So the waist axis is a VERTICAL LINE
    THROUGH THE BASE ORIGIN's (x, y).  Rotate only the waist and every
    point on the arm sweeps a circle centred on that line.  Fit the circle
    through your marks and its centre IS the base (x, y) -- measured
    directly, with no IK, no FK, and no dependence on any other joint's
    calibration.

SPACE.  READ THIS FIRST.
    The arm sweeps an arc at whatever radius it is currently extended to.
    The sweep is RELATIVE to the arm's current waist angle and defaults to
    a 90 deg total arc -- it does NOT do a full revolution.  Before moving,
    the script prints the swept envelope of EVERY link (not just the
    gripper, which is not the widest part) including the configurations
    passed through in between, and asks you to confirm it fits.

    The IK collision model checks the robot against ITSELF only.  It knows
    nothing about the table, the frame bars or the workstation.  Record the
    free space in workspace_limits.json and the envelope gets checked
    automatically; until then, check it by eye.

    Tuck the arm in first if space is tight -- a smaller radius sweeps a
    smaller area.  Trade-off below.

How wide an arc, and how far extended?
    Two knobs, and they trade against each other.

    ARC.  A short arc pins the circle centre poorly along the radial
    direction.  For a symmetric arc of half-angle a and marking precision
    s, the centre error is roughly  s / (1 - cos a):

        full 360 deg       ->  ~s / sqrt(N)   (best, and radius-independent)
        total arc 180 deg  ->  1.0 x s
        total arc 120 deg  ->  2.0 x s
        total arc  90 deg  ->  3.4 x s        (default, untucked)
        total arc  60 deg  ->  7.5 x s
        total arc  40 deg  ->   16 x s        (too narrow to be useful)

    EXTENSION.  Radius sets how much floor the sweep needs.  It barely
    affects accuracy once you have a FULL circle -- there the centre error
    is about s/sqrt(N) whatever the radius, so long as the marks are far
    enough apart to tell apart.

    THE GOOD COMBINATION, if your rig has the headroom: --tuck --arc 360.
    Standing the arm upright and holding the gripper ~150 mm off its own
    waist axis lets it turn all the way round inside a ~450 mm square,
    while giving the best centre estimate available.  Compare that with an
    untucked 360 deg sweep, which needs the better part of a metre.

    Note the swept envelope is wider than the gripper's own radius -- the
    elbow and forearm swing further out than the fingertips.  The printed
    envelope accounts for every link; do not size your free space off the
    gripper radius alone.

What you do
    1. Tape paper on the table under the gripper.
    2. With --tuck, confirm the move into the upright pose first.
    3. Confirm the swept envelope the script prints.
    4. It rotates ONLY the waist to each angle in turn, pausing at each.
    4. At each pause, drop a plumb line from the SAME physical feature
       every time (a fingertip) and mark the point.
    5. Enter the marks into the saved JSON. The circle through them has its
       centre at the waist axis = the base origin's (x, y).

Reading the result
    Fit a circle to the marks (three non-collinear points determine one;
    more is better). Its centre, in your world reference, is the measured
    base (x, y). A consistent offset from the URDF value is a real base
    placement error. If the marks do not lie on a circle at all, something
    upstream is wrong -- a loose base, or the arm flexing under its own
    weight at that extension.
""",

"straight": """
STRAIGHT  --  measures a base's YAW
===================================
Why it works
    A yaw error rotates everything that arm does about its own base.  Ask
    the end-effector to travel along the world +x axis and it will instead
    travel along a line rotated by the yaw error.  Over a path of length
    L, a yaw error theta shows up as a sideways deviation

        d = L * sin(theta)        i.e.   theta = asin(d / L)

    which is a distance, and distances are measurable.  Long L makes small
    angles visible: over 300 mm, 1 mm of deviation is 0.19 deg.

What you do
    1. Clamp a straightedge on the table along your world +x reference,
       just under the gripper's path.
    2. The script steps the end-effector along world +x in a straight
       line, pausing at each step.
    3. At each pause measure the PERPENDICULAR distance from the
       straightedge to the same physical feature on the gripper.
    4. The deviation should be constant.  If it grows or shrinks
       monotonically along the path, the difference between the first and
       last reading is your yaw error over that length.

Reading the result
    theta = asin((d_end - d_start) / path_length).  Sign: if the far end
    drifts toward +y, the base yaw is rotated positively about +z.
    A CONSTANT non-zero offset is not yaw -- that is just where the
    straightedge sits, and it cancels.
""",

"floor": """
FLOOR  --  checks the vertical chain against the tabletop
=========================================================
Why it works
    Rest part of the gripper on the table.  That contact point is at the
    table's height, exactly, by definition.  Whatever the model says its
    height is, the difference is the error in the vertical chain: base z,
    link lengths, joint calibration, or the feature offset.

    The awkward part is knowing WHICH point is touching.  With any roll on
    the wrist it is not the TCP and not the flange -- it is whichever bit
    of geometry hangs lowest.  So this reads the arm's collision spheres
    (the same 180-sphere model the IK uses) and reports the lowest point of
    the actual geometry, not a frame origin.

What you do
    1. Rest the gripper on the tabletop, any roll, both arms if you like.
    2. Run it. Nothing moves -- it only reads joint states.
    3. Compare the reported lowest-point height against the table height.

Reading the result
    The table is world z = 0 by default (the arm bases sit on 20 mm risers,
    which is the 0.020 in the URDF, so the tabletop is the z = 0 plane).
    Override with --table-z if your rig differs.

    A consistent offset on BOTH arms points at the world z datum or the
    base height.  A difference BETWEEN the arms points at one arm's
    calibration.  Note the sphere model is inscribed and reads a few mm
    optimistic, so expect the lowest sphere to sit slightly ABOVE the true
    surface even when everything is right.
""",

"separation": """
SEPARATION  --  checks the base x-separation against one ruler reading
======================================================================
Why it works
    Each arm's forward kinematics is correct RELATIVE TO ITS OWN BASE.  If
    the two bases are modelled closer together than they really are, every
    world-frame quantity is fine per arm but the two arms appear too close
    to each other -- they can even look interpenetrating in the viewer
    while being nowhere near each other in the room.

    The gap between the two grippers is that error, directly.  Measure it
    once and the base separation follows:

        measured_gap^2 = (dx + delta)^2 + dy^2 + dz^2

    solved for delta, the correction to the modelled x-separation.

What you do
    1. Leave the arms wherever they are -- any pose works, but one with
       the grippers reasonably close and clearly visible is easiest to
       measure.  Nothing moves and nothing is torqued on.
    2. The script prints the gap the MODEL predicts, and what the gap
       would be for a few alternative base separations.
    3. Measure the actual gap between the same two features on the two
       gripper mounting plates.
    4. Pass it back with --measured-gap-mm and it back-solves the implied
       base separation.

Reading the result
    An implied separation close to the URDF's value (1040 mm since the
    2026-08-19 correction; 938 mm before it) means the model is
    right and the apparent closeness is just the render.  A consistently
    larger value across several different poses means the URDF's base
    x-separation is too small by that amount -- and every world-frame
    number involving both arms inherits it.

    Repeat at two or three quite different poses.  A real base error gives
    the SAME implied separation every time; measurement slop does not.
""",

"converge": """
CONVERGE  --  measures the RELATIVE pose of two bases (and their yaw)
=====================================================================
Why it works
    Command both arms to put their end-effectors at the SAME world point.
    If both base transforms are correct, the two frames physically
    coincide.  Whatever gap you can measure between them is the error in
    the relative base transform -- and this needs NO external reference
    frame at all, which is what makes it the most trustworthy of the
    three.

    Yaw falls out of doing it twice.  A relative yaw error produces a gap
    that CHANGES as you move the meeting point along y:

        relative_yaw ~= (gap_x at P2 - gap_x at P1) / (y2 - y1)

What you do
    1. The script brings both grippers to the same commanded world point
       and pauses.  They will not collide -- the meeting point is offset
       so the fingertips sit side by side rather than inside each other.
    2. Measure the gap between the two corresponding features (left
       fingertip to left fingertip) along each axis.
    3. It repeats at a second point displaced along y.  Measure again.
    4. Record both gaps.

Reading the result
    The gap at a single point is the relative translation error.  The
    CHANGE in the x-gap between the two points, divided by their y
    separation, is the relative yaw error in radians.

    This measures right-base-relative-to-left.  It cannot tell you which
    of the two is wrong in world terms -- only that they disagree.  Use
    waist-circle for the absolute placement of each.
