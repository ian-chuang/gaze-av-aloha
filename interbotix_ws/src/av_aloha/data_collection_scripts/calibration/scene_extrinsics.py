"""Extrinsic calibration of the STATIC scene cameras -- top_scene, low_scene.

    collect   capture ChArUco views both cameras can see
    solve     camera-to-camera geometry from those views    -> stereo_*.json
    anchor    tie the pair to the robot world frame         -> anchor_*.json
    write     compose the two into ee_camera_transforms.json
    status    what exists and what is missing

These two cameras are bolted to the rig, not to an arm, so what they need
is `T_base_camera` directly -- there is no `T_ee_camera` for them.  Before
this script, `camera_mount.CAMERA_MOUNTS` listed both with
`provenance: unknown` and `T_parent_optical: None`, and `T_world_camera()`
raised for them.  That was correct: nothing knew where they were.


WHY IT IS SPLIT INTO TWO STAGES, AND WHY THAT ORDER
===================================================
`solve` and `anchor` answer different questions and must not be merged.

`solve` uses only a board held in the air.  It learns where the two
cameras are RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER, and its metric scale comes from the
measured ChArUco square -- no robot, no URDF, no forward kinematics
anywhere in the chain.  After this stage alone you can already measure
lengths, sizes and separations, and check them against the rulers on the
table.  **Everything measured at this stage is independent evidence about
the robot**, and that is the entire point.

`anchor` then finds where that rig sits in the robot's world frame, by
comparing points the robot claims to be at with where the cameras see it.
The fit residual is not a nuisance -- it IS the measurement of how far
forward kinematics disagrees with reality.

Doing it the other way round -- calibrating the cameras against the robot
first -- would make the cameras inherit whatever the URDF gets wrong, and
they could then never detect it.  The measurement would be circular and
would look perfect.  It is worth being explicit about this because the
circular version is easier to run and gives lower residuals.


THE DISTORTION-DIRECTION TRAP, HANDLED
======================================
The D405 factory intrinsics are `inverse_brown_conrady`: the coefficients
run PIXEL -> RAY.  OpenCV's `solvePnP` and `stereoCalibrate` expect
coefficients running RAY -> PIXEL.  Handing the factory numbers straight
to OpenCV applies them backwards -- roughly a double distortion, a few
pixels at the image edge, and nothing anywhere would report an error.

So this script never passes distortion coefficients to OpenCV.  Detected
corners are converted to NORMALISED RAYS first, by
`reconstruction.PinholeCamera.unproject`, which knows which direction each
model runs.  OpenCV is then called with `K = I` and `dist = 0`, for which
both conventions agree trivially.  A consequence worth knowing: the RMS
figures below are in NORMALISED units scaled back to pixels by the mean
focal length, not raw OpenCV pixel residuals.

## The input is a set of CORRESPONDENCES: for each one, where the robot
## says a point is (forward kinematics from the measured joint angles) and
## where the cameras see it (triangulated).  `world_view.py`'s Measure tab
## records these; the format is documented in the README.
##
## The fit is deliberately run TWICE:
##
##   rigid       6 dof.  The residual is the honest disagreement between

##               by the fit, which is exactly why it is the measurement.
##
##   similarity  7 dof, adding a scale factor.  If a scale materially
##               different from 1 fits better, something is wrong with a
##               LENGTH: the ChArUco square measurement (which sets the
##               cameras' scale) or the URDF link lengths (which set the
##               robot's).  Reporting only the rigid fit would smear that
##               into the residual and hide it.
##
## The residual is then split into a CONSTANT OFFSET and SCATTER, because
## they have different causes and different fixes.  A constant offset that
## survives the fit means a frame is defined in the wrong place -- which is
## precisely the shape of a "the gripper is 10 cm from where the software
## thinks" complaint.  Scatter means joint calibration, backlash,
## compliance or click noise.
