"""Two-camera synchronisation measurement  (PHASE 7).

Runs two (or more) RealSense cameras concurrently and records, for every
paired capture, every clock the hardware and driver expose.  Then reports
the offset between them over many samples so the timing behaviour of this
rig can be characterised rather than assumed.


WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT ESTABLISH
==================================
It measures SOFTWARE-OBSERVABLE timing.  It cannot prove hardware
synchronisation, and nothing in this rig provides any:

  * The D405s have no external sync cabling here, and no
    ``inter_cam_sync_mode`` is configured, so their shutters free-run
    independently at 60 fps.  Two cameras will drift relative to each other
    at whatever their crystal difference is.
  * ``timestamp_domain = global_time`` does NOT mean the cameras are
    synchronised.  It means librealsense is fitting a linear map from each
    device's own clock onto the host epoch, independently per device.  The
    fit has its own error and re-converges over time.
  * ``time_of_arrival`` and ``backend_timestamp`` are HOST timestamps taken
    after USB transfer.  They include transfer and scheduling jitter, which
    is unrelated to when the exposure happened.

The clock that comes closest to "when the photons landed" is the metadata
``sensor_timestamp`` (device clock, microseconds, start of exposure) -- but
it lives in each device's OWN time base, so a raw difference between two
cameras' sensor timestamps is an arbitrary constant plus drift, not a
latency.  Read the per-clock sections separately; they are reported
separately for exactly this reason.

The number that matters operationally is usually the spread (std, p95,
min-max range) rather than the mean: a constant offset can be calibrated
out, jitter cannot.


CAPTURE MODEL
=============
One thread per camera blocks on ``wait_for_frames`` and keeps the newest
frame -- the same latest-frame-wins model ``camera_manager.py`` uses in
production, so the numbers describe what data collection actually sees.
The sampler then takes both cameras' newest frames under one lock.

That means a sample can pick up a frame that has been sitting there a
while.  Frame ages at sample time are recorded, and repeated frame numbers
are counted and reported: a high duplicate rate means the sample rate is
outrunning the cameras and those samples are not independent measurements.

Examples

    python calibration/sync_capture.py --cameras left_wrist right_wrist \\
        --samples 300

    # save the paired images too, and turn global time off to see the raw
    # device clocks
    python calibration/sync_capture.py --cameras left_wrist right_wrist \\
        --samples 100 --save-images --no-global-time

  Read this together with the numbers above.  'global_time' means
  librealsense mapped each DEVICE's clock onto the host epoch with its own
  independent linear fit -- the cameras are not synchronised, they are
  merely both estimated against the host.  'hardware_clock' means the raw
  device counter, whose origin is arbitrary and differs per device.

  Neither proves the shutters fired together. Only the spread (std, range)
  and the drift bound how well any software alignment can do here.
