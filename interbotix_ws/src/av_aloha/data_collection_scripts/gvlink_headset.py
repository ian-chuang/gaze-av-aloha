"""
Headset link over the gvlink UDP stack -- a drop-in replacement for WebRTCHeadset.

The Unity viewer moved off WebRTC/Firestore (av-aloha-unity branch v2) onto a direct
UDP transport: fragmented H.264 video, a TCP control channel, and a fixed-size input
uplink at display rate. Nothing is negotiated through the cloud and there is no
signalling handshake -- the headset finds this process by LAN beacon, or is given its
address, opens the control channel, and video starts flowing to wherever that
connection came from.

This class keeps WebRTCHeadset's public surface exactly:

    headset = GvLinkHeadset()
    headset.run_in_thread()
    while not headset.data_channel_open: ...
    headset.send_images(left_bgr, right_bgr)
    data = headset.receive_data()          # HeadsetData, or None
    headset.send_feedback(feedback)
    headset.close()

so data_collection.py, camera_manager.py and oak_to_headset.py only need the import
swapped. Everything below that line is different.

Two behaviours worth knowing, because they differ from the WebRTC version:

*   send_images() does not encode on the calling thread. It drops the pair into a
    one-slot mailbox and returns; an encoder thread picks up the newest pair and sends
    it. The OAK capture loop therefore never waits on H.264, and if capture outruns the
    encoder the intermediate pairs are discarded rather than queued -- a frame from two
    captures ago is worth less than the current one.

*   The viewer is told the real camera geometry (rectified intrinsics + baseline) over
    the control channel, and places each image from it. That replaces the operator
    guessing a field of view in the headset settings. Pass a calibration JSON if you
    have one; otherwise a symmetric pinhole is synthesised from `hfov`, which is a
    starting point rather than the truth.

gvlink itself lives in the Unity repo next to the viewer that has to agree with it
byte for byte, so it is imported rather than vendored -- one copy, no drift. Point
GVLINK_PATH at it if it is not in the default place.
