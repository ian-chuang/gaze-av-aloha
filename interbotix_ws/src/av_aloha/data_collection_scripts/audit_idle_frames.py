"""How much of a recorded dataset is the arm sitting still?

WHY YOU WOULD RUN THIS
======================
Recording starts when the operator presses 'r', but teleoperation starts when
they put the headset on and squeeze a button.  Every frame in between is the
arm PARKED AT THE RESET POSE, recorded with `action` == that pose.  A few
seconds of it per episode, times a hundred episodes, and the reset pose becomes
the single most common action in the dataset -- at near-zero variance, paired
with observations of a scene that is not moving.

A behaviour-cloning policy trained on that learns "static scene -> reset pose"
as a high-confidence mapping, and reproduces it exactly whenever a rollout
reaches a state where nothing is changing, which in practice means right after
it finishes the task.  It looks like the reset motion leaked into the data.  It
did not: the reset pose was at the FRONT of every episode all along.

This script measures the effect so it is a number rather than a theory:

    python audit_idle_frames.py --dataset-root <run folder>
    python audit_idle_frames.py --task active_vision_data_collection

Reads the parquet directly -- no lerobot, no ROS, no video decoding -- so it
runs on a laptop against a copied dataset.

FIXING IT is GIAVA_RECORD_GATE=teleop in data_collection.py (now the default),
which simply does not write frames until teleop is first enabled.  For datasets
already recorded, the lead-in reported here is what you would trim.
