##
## The cameras free-run.  These D405s do NOT support inter_cam_sync_mode
## (verified on all four at firmware 5.12.14.100 -- only
## output_trigger_enabled is exposed), so there is no hardware genlock
## available and alignment has to happen in software.
##
## The historical behaviour was latest-frame-wins: each tick took whatever
## frame each camera happened to have most recently produced.  How stale
## that frame was depended on when the tick happened to poll relative to
## each camera's phase, so the skew was bounded only by a full frame period
## (16.7 ms at 60 fps) and moved around tick to tick.
##
## Instead, keep a short history per camera and pick, for each one, the
## frame nearest a common reference instant -- the newest instant EVERY
## camera has already covered, so no camera is asked for a frame it has not
## produced.  Each chosen frame is then within HALF a frame period of that
## reference (<=8.3 ms at 60 fps), bounded and independent of polling phase,
## and the reference is recorded alongside.
##
## WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: it cannot reduce the spread BETWEEN cameras below
## their relative phase offset.  Measured on this rig with three cameras all
## running a true 60.2 fps and dense histories, the per-camera offsets from
## the reference were -6.16 / 0.00 / +5.41 ms -- each well inside the
## half-period bound, but an 11.6 ms spread overall.  That spread is the
## cameras' physical phase difference: frames simply do not exist at the
## same instants, and no selection rule can invent them.  Closing it needs
## hardware sync, which the D405 does not offer.
##
## What makes it useful anyway: the offsets are STABLE (std 0.027 ms over
## 150 samples), so they are a calibratable constant rather than noise --
## provided the per-camera timestamp is recorded faithfully, which is why
## the dataset stores them as float64.  select_synchronized_frames reports
## the achieved spread per timestep so this can be checked, not assumed.

## intrinsics -- every run.  All of it is true and none of it needs acting on,
## and it sat directly above the [SAFETY] / [profile] lines that do.
##
## _info() carries the routine lines; anything describing a FAILURE, a missing
## device, a fallback that changes behaviour, or a degraded link stays on a
## plain print() and is always shown.  The intrinsics in particular are not
## lost by hiding them: save_camera_intrinsics() writes them into the dataset
## itself, which is where they are actually needed.

## about a third of every transmitted frame was black border that the encoder
## still had to spend bitrate on, and the resize + canvas copy ran twice per
## frame on the capture thread that feeds the encoder.
