"""One switch for which backend the coupled IK solver runs on.

WHY THIS IS A FILE AND NOT A LINE
=================================
`JAX_PLATFORMS` has to be in the environment BEFORE jax is imported anywhere,
and jax gets pulled in transitively (jaxlie, pyroki, yourdfpy's viewer...).
Every entry point therefore has to set it as its very first act, and the
several places that did so had drifted into disagreeing with each other --
`data_collection.py` pinned CPU at line 6 while `study_ik.py` pinned CPU again
at import.  One place, one rule, so a change lands everywhere at once.

CPU FOR THE BARE SOLVER, GPU FOR THE FULL ONE
=============================================
The ik_study measurement that pinned CPU was taken on the BARE pose-tracking
solver: three SE3 residuals, ~50 optimisation variables, ~5 ms/solve on CPU
and slower on GPU -- at that size the kernel launch overhead and the
host<->device round trip per LM iteration dominate the arithmetic completely.

The deployed solver is not that solver.  It carries the 180-sphere
self-collision cost (thousands of pairwise distances per residual evaluation,
re-evaluated every LM iteration) and now the tabletop half-space term as
well.  That is the regime where the arithmetic finally outweighs the launch
overhead, which is why this defaults to GPU-first while the study's CPU
finding remains true of what it measured.

    GIAVA_JAX_PLATFORM=gpu    (default) try CUDA, fall back to CPU
    GIAVA_JAX_PLATFORM=cpu              force CPU (the study's configuration)
    GIAVA_JAX_PLATFORM=cuda             GPU only -- fail loudly if absent

or per run:  python data_collection.py --jax cpu

FALLBACK IS SILENT BY CONSTRUCTION, SO IT IS REPORTED
=====================================================
`JAX_PLATFORMS="cuda,cpu"` is jax's own priority list: CUDA if it initialises,
CPU otherwise, with no error either way.  That is the behaviour we want (a
missing driver must not stop data collection) and also the failure mode that
hides a GPU that quietly never engaged -- so `describe()` below is printed
after the solver is built, naming the device actually in use.
