# Phase 1 — Baseline IK: exact specification

Status: **reference implementation** (`baseline.py`). Once signed off, this
problem definition is frozen; every later variant is baseline + exactly one
documented change.

## 1. The objective being optimized

One nonlinear least-squares problem over all 23 actuated joints, solved once
per control tick:

```
min_q  Σ_{a ∈ {left, right, middle}}  || W_a · r_a(q) ||²
s.t.   lower_j ≤ q_j ≤ upper_j        (augmented-Lagrangian constraint)
```

- `q ∈ R²³`: 6 joints per hand arm, 2 finger joints per hand, 7 camera-arm
  joints. All three arms are solved **coupled** in a single problem (they do
  not share joints, but they share the solve, the damping schedule, and the
  termination decision).
- `r_a(q) = log( T_a(q)⁻¹ · T_a* ) ∈ R⁶` — the SE(3) logarithm of the pose
  error between the FK pose `T_a(q)` of the arm's target link and the
  commanded pose `T_a*`.
- Target links: `left_gripper_base`, `right_gripper_base`, `middle_camera_cover`.

## 2. Position residual

The first three components of the SE(3) log: `r_pos = ρ(q) · pos_weight`.

Precisely: PyRoki computes `(T_actual⁻¹ T_target).log()`; the translational
part of that twist is **not** the raw Euclidean displacement — it is the
body-frame translational velocity of the geodesic connecting the two poses
(`V⁻¹ · Δt` with the SO(3) left-Jacobian inverse `V⁻¹`). For pose errors up to
a few cm / tens of degrees it is numerically close to the Euclidean error, and
it vanishes exactly when positions coincide. Evaluation metrics (Phase 3)
therefore use plain Euclidean distance, computed *outside* the solver — the
residual and the metric are deliberately not the same expression.

Implementation: `pk.costs.pose_cost_analytic_jac` — residual **and its
Jacobian** are analytic PyRoki code (`_pose_residual_analytic_jac.py`); no
automatic differentiation is involved in the pose term.

## 3. Orientation residual

The last three components of the same SE(3) log: `r_ori = ω(q) · ori_weight`,
where `ω` is the axis-angle (SO(3) log) of the relative rotation
`R_actual⁻¹ R_target`, in radians. Zero iff orientations coincide; norm equals
the geodesic angle. No Euler angles anywhere.

## 4. Position/orientation weighting

PyRoki's canonical basic-IK defaults, applied identically to all three arms:

| | value | unit |
|---|---|---|
| `pos_weight` | **50.0** | 1/m |
| `ori_weight` | **10.0** | 1/rad |

Interpretation: the optimizer trades errors at the ratio at which weighted
residuals are equal — `50·e_pos = 10·e_ori` → **1 rad ≙ 0.20 m**, i.e.
1° ≙ 3.5 mm. Whether that trade is right for teleoperation is exactly the
Phase 5 question; the baseline simply fixes the library default.

Weights are runtime arguments of the compiled solve (changing them does not
recompile), but Phases 3–4 run everything at the values above.

Note: the deployed solver (`three_arm_ik.py`) currently uses ori_weight 2–5,
i.e. it values orientation 2–5× *less* than the PyRoki default. This is one of
the things Phase 5 will adjudicate.

## 5. Constraints and joint limits

`pk.costs.limit_constraint(robot, joint_var)` — PyRoki-native. Residual per
joint: `max(0, q − upper) + max(0, lower − q)` (zero inside the range).
jaxls treats it as a **constraint** (`leq_zero`), handled by an augmented
Lagrangian: penalty + multiplier terms added to the least-squares objective,
multipliers updated in outer iterations until the constraint holds. This is
firmer than a fixed-weight penalty but still not a projection: violations can
transiently survive if the LM budget is exhausted. Phase 3 measures actual
violations rather than assuming zero.

No other constraints. Fingers are included in `q` but no cost touches them
except the limit constraint (they are downstream of every target link), so LM
damping leaves them at their initialization.

Velocity limits: **none in the baseline** (no smoothing term, no post-solve
clamp). The baseline is pure per-tick pose IK; anything temporal is an
ablation.

## 6. Solver configuration

jaxls Levenberg-Marquardt, matching PyRoki's basic-IK example exactly:

| setting | value | origin |
|---|---|---|
| algorithm | Levenberg-Marquardt (trust-region damping) | jaxls default when `trust_region` is given |
| linear solver | `dense_cholesky` (23×23 normal equations) | PyRoki example |
| `lambda_initial` | **1.0** | PyRoki example (jaxls default would be 5e-4) |
| `lambda_factor` | 2.0 | jaxls default |
| `lambda_min` / `lambda_max` | 1e-5 / 1e6 | jaxls default |
| `step_quality_min` | 1e-3 | jaxls default |
| dtype | float32 | JAX default |
| device | fixed per experiment run, recorded in results (CPU primary; see Phase 3 conditions) | study decision |

## 7. Initialization

Warm start: `q_init` = the configuration commanded at the previous tick
(first tick: the URDF home configuration). The augmented-Lagrangian
multipliers start fresh every tick (no carry-over; that is how the PyRoki
examples use jaxls).

This is the one unavoidable temporal coupling in the baseline: LM is local, so
the warm start picks the solution basin. It is initialization, not a cost
term, and is identical across all variants — so ablation deltas are still
attributable to the residual being added.

## 8. Convergence criteria (jaxls, all native defaults)

Early termination fires when **any** of:

| criterion | condition | value |
|---|---|---|
| cost tolerance | `|Δcost| / cost < tol` (non-constraint cost) | 1e-5 |
| gradient tolerance | `‖retract(x, ATb) − x‖_∞ < tol`, checked from iteration 10 | 1e-4 |
| parameter tolerance | `‖δ‖₂ < (‖x‖₂ + tol) · tol` | 1e-6 |

## 9. Stopping criteria

`max_iterations = 100` per inner LM solve (jaxls default; kept for the
baseline — a deployment budget like 20–30 would be a *variant* decision, not a
baseline one). For the constrained problem this bounds each inner solve, with
augmented-Lagrangian multiplier updates between inner solves.

Reported per solve (`SolveResult`): iterations of the final inner solve, which
termination criterion fired (all-false + iterations == max means budget
exhausted), wall-clock ms including device sync and excluding JIT compile
(`warmup()` is called first).

## 10. What is PyRoki-native vs. custom

| piece | origin |
|---|---|
| pose residual + analytic Jacobian | PyRoki (`pose_cost_analytic_jac`) |
| joint-limit constraint | PyRoki (`limit_constraint`) + jaxls augmented Lagrangian |
| LM solver, damping, termination | jaxls (native defaults except `lambda_initial=1.0` from the PyRoki example) |
| weights 50/10 | PyRoki basic-IK example defaults |
| problem assembly, warm start bookkeeping, timing | custom (this study), ~40 lines |

Explicitly **absent** (deferred to Phase 4 ablations): smoothing /
previous-configuration regularization, joint centering, rest pose, collision
(self or world), manipulability, limit barrier, velocity/acceleration clamps,
target/output filtering, re-seeding or recovery logic.

## 11. Known baseline properties to keep in mind when reading results

- Without smoothing, nothing ties tick t to tick t−1 except the warm start;
  configuration flips between equally good basins are *expected* and are part
  of what the smoothing ablation measures.
- Without any redundancy resolution, the 7-DoF camera arm's null space is
  fixed only by the warm start + LM damping; slow null-space drift is possible.
- `limit_constraint` reacts to violation; it does not keep a margin.
