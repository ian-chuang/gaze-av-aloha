"""World collision: a tabletop half-plane, for `pk.costs.world_collision_cost`.

WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM SELF-COLLISION
=========================================
Self-collision (collision_models.py, COLLISION_STUDY.md) checks robot
geometry against itself; this checks the same sphere geometry against one
static plane.  PyRoki ships this natively as `world_collision_residual` /
`pk.costs.world_collision_cost` -- no new distance math is needed, just the
plane and which geometries should be allowed to feel it.

SEMANTICS: CONTACT IS ALLOWED, PENETRATION IS NOT
==================================================
Unlike the inter-arm gate (which must PROVE separation), resting a hand or
the camera housing ON the table is a normal, wanted pose.  So this uses the
same soft-hinge shape as the validated self-collision cost (colldist_from_sdf:
zero above the margin, a quadratic ramp inside it) via `world_collision_cost`
-- NOT `world_collision_constraint` (the AL/constraint form).  Phase 9 of
COLLISION_STUDY.md already measured the AL form fighting boundary-riding
(81 LM iterations / 80% non-convergence holding a margin) and diverging
under infeasible commands for the self-collision case; there is no reason to
expect a plane constraint to behave better under a command that deliberately
presses down, and no sweep has tested it, so the soft form is the only one
in use here.

WHICH LINKS SEE THE PLANE
==========================
Every sphere in the deployed decomposition, MINUS the links that are
kinematically height-invariant relative to the table -- their own actuated
joint (waist yaw) cannot change how far they are from it, so a plane cost on
them is pure constant bias with no discriminative signal, exactly the C3
"structural" failure mode from the self-collision study.

Measured over the full frozen baseline corpus (results/baseline/*.npz,
`../../scratchpad` survey, 2026-08-23): every *_base_link and *_shoulder_link
reported EXACTLY ZERO height range (0.0 mm min-to-max) across every saved
trajectory -- they sit strictly between the base mount and the first
height-changing joint, so this is a kinematic fact, not a corpus-coverage
artifact:

    left_base_link, right_base_link, middle_base_link   (~20 mm rest height)
    left_shoulder_link, right_shoulder_link              (~96 mm)
    middle_shoulder_link                                 (~89 mm)

Excluded for that reason.  Everything else -- INCLUDING the camera housing
(middle_camera_body/cover ranged 8-384 mm over the corpus: it genuinely
swings close to the table during reach-down motions) and the finger links
(29-689 mm: real grasp-off-the-table proximity) -- keeps its plane check,
because those ARE the configurations a table cost needs to see.

STATUS: UNVALIDATED
====================
This mirrors the self-collision winner's margin/weight (20 mm / 100) as a
starting point ONLY -- no Phase-9-style margin x weight sweep, no
mesh-ground-truth check, and no hardware trial has been run for this term.
Treat GIAVA_IK_TABLE_* as an experiment, not a deployed default: it must be
explicitly enabled (see study_ik.py) and inspected in Viser
(view_table_collision.py) before it is trusted on hardware.
